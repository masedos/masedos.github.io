### Classification problems 

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

[Github](/masedos) [Colab](/masedos/)

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on Kaggle. Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.
